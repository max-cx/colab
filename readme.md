This is a repo for quick and simple collaboration on developing new content.
This repo is meant as a better alternative to GitHub gists.

To add a topic for us to collaborate on:
- No need to create any fork.
- Every developer on this team is already added as a collaborator to this repo.
- Just create a new branch in this repo and then create a cross-branch PR from that branch to `main`, same repo, no forks.
- You can edit files in the GitHub UI or set this repo up as the `origin` remote if you want to use your editor on your laptop.
